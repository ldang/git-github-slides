# Git and GitHub Tips and Tricks

A presentation for the San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group October 2014 monthly meeting.

Developed using [reveal.js](https://travis-ci.org/hakimel/reveal.js.png?branch=master), a framework for easily creating beautiful presentations using HTML. [Check out the live demo](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/).

Thanks to James McDuffie for recommending the framework and blazing the way.
