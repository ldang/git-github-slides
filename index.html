              ### About the talk
              ------------------
              * This is version 0.1 of a planned sequel to [Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) & Mercurial](http://bit.ly/10OIsby)
              * Will be reprised at a future LUG talk, when I have more time to work on it
              * All I want is for you to learn something you didn't already know about Git or GitHub
              * Questions and comments welcome; feel free to interrupt
              * No live demo

              --------------------
              * HTML5 presentation framework: [reveal.js framework](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/)
              * See all the iterations of my slides--yes, this was a last-minute thing
              https://github.com/ldang/git-github-slides/

              * This presentation is being served on my local machine, but it can also be viewed on GitHub
              https://ldang.github.io/git-github-slides

              NOTE: My local copy will be more up-to-date than the GitHub copy until I'm finished.

              ### About me
              ------------
              * I spend a lot of time logged into remote Linux machines
              * I love the command line
              * I am not a Git/GitHub expert, but I have a professional interest in distributed version control
              * I am not a software developer, though I occasionally play one at work
              * I write tools using primarily shell scripts with the occasional dash of Python
              * My favorite tools are bash, awk, vim, GNU screen, git, GitHub

              ### About Git
              -------------
              * Distributed version control system
              * "Time machine" for text files
              * Often pre-installed on Linux systems
              * A bit of a learning curve
              * GUIs are available, but you still need the command line for some of the advanced functionality

              ### About GitHub (1)
              --------------------
              * Collaboration platform, originally meant for software projects
                * Access control and organization system
                * Git/Subversion repository hosting
                * Issue tracking
                * Wiki
                * GitHub Pages (project web pages)
                * GitHub Gists (version-controlled pastebin)

              ### About GitHub (2)
              --------------------
              * Free for public repositories, and there is affordable pricing scheme if you need private repositories
              * User-friendly.  Easy to use, and you get hints all the time of how to do things
              * Gists are basically lightweight repositories, which are great for just dumping code fragments or how-tos
              * You can edit the files in the repository using the web interface
              * GitHub-flavored Markdown - a source code-friendly version of Markdown to write documentation
              * Encourages code remix and reuse and collaboration through forking and pull requests

              ### About GitHub (3)
              --------------------
              * GitHub Enterprise is self-hosted version aimed at companies that want to keep their repositories in-house.
                * Makes it easy for everyone to practice version control without overhead of running own server
                * Encourages sharing of code, so we can learn from each other and not reinvent the wheel
                * Good way to share domain knowledge because we can provide documentation as well as source code
              * Desktop apps: GitHub GUI for Mac, Atom text editor, Gollum wiki software
              * Extensive Git/GitHub training material available [here](https://training.github.com/)

             ### Turning a directory into a Git repository
             ---------------------------------------------
             * Assuming git is already installed
             ```
             cd test_repo
             # Initialize git repository
             git init
             # Add the contents of the current directory to be tracked by git
             git add .
             git commit -m "Initial commit"

              ### Making a new repository in GitHub
              -----------------------------------
              * Go to GitHub website.  (Helpful if you are already logged in.)
              https://github.com/new
              * Follow the instructions. GitHub gives you many options; pick the one that matches your situation
                * This is how I posted these slides to GitHub, using a git repository I already had.
              ```
              cd git-github-talk-2014-10-09
              git remote add origin git@github.com:ldang/git-github-slides.git
              # Push a local branch to a remote repo for the first time
              # origin is usually what we call the remote repo we cloned from
              git push -u origin master
              ```
            </script>

              ###GitHub-Flavored Markdown
              * GitHub supports [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) as one of the ways to format text on GitHub in issues, gists, wikis, text files.
              * GitHub-Flavored Markdown is a variant of Markdown that includes some extra syntax and a slight change in behavior to make it more source code and GitHub-friendly.  See [here](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) for documentation.
              * [Here](https://help.github.com/articles/writing-on-github/) is more advice on how to format text on GitHub.

              ### Committing changes
              -----------------------
              * New files need to be registered with the repository before git will "track" it.
                ```
                # Adds the current directory and all files in it
                git add .
                ```
              * By default, git only commits changes that are staged, usually using "git add"
              ```
                git add newfile
                git commit -m "Adding new files"
              ```
              * You can just commit everything using the -a option.  But this only commits changes to tracked files.  You still need to explicitly add new files.
              ```
              git commit -a -m "Saving changes"
              ```

              ### Best practices for log messages
              -----------------------------------
              * If you are doing short log messages, you can just embed it in the commandline
              ```
              git commit -m "This is my log message"
              ```
              * If you are doing fairly long messages, then commit without "-m" option; git will open up your default text editor
              ```
              git commit
              ```
              * When writing multi-line log messages, the first line should be crafted carefully to summarize the commit.  There are many ways of looking at the git log, and some of them are very compact and only show the first line.  
            </script>

              ### Best practices for repository management
              --------------------------------------------
              * Find a central place to organize your repositories, no matter how trivial the repos are.
                * The power of distributed version control is that it is *distributed*
                * It is your backup if you mess up your working repository
                  * Even if you lose your current work, that should only set you back a few hours, not weeks
                * This central place is easy to backup for automated backups.
                * It is easy to identify as the place most likely to have the most complete version of the repository. 
                  * You may have use cases where you have one or more clones of the repository on various machines

              * For many people, this central place is GitHub.  For other people, it is a bare repo in their home directory
            </script>

              ### Bare repositories (1)
              -------------------------
              * A git repository normally consists of the repository (in a hidden .git folder) and the set of working files and directories that represent the state of the repository at a given point in time.
              * The working files are only useful if you're actually working on them.  Otherwise, they just take up space.
              * There are cases where you want a bare repository
                * As a way to share your git repository with other people
                * As a way to backup your git repository
              * A bare repository is a repository that doesn't have a working directory
              * Bare repositories are usually initialized and cloned. Changes are synchronized via pushing and pulling.

              ### Bare repositories (2)
              -------------------------
              ```
              # bare repositories usually have naming convention <repo>.git
              git init ~/my_new_repo.git

              mkdir my_test
              git clone ~/my_new_repo.git

              ###Changing a remote's URL
              --------------------------
              * You can map names to remote repositories.  By default, the remote repository you clone is known as "origin"
                * When you establish a link to a remote repo, you can designate a different name
              * Sometimes, you want to change what "origin" points to.  Apparently, one reason may be that you want to change how you are accessing the remote Git repo--usually changing from HTTPS to SSH.  (GitHub has a [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-remote-s-url/) regarding this.)
                * When you authenticate over HTTPS, GitHub will ask for your username and password
                * If you use SSH, you can setup SSH key authentication instead.  You can upload your public key to your GitHub profile.
                ```
                git remote set-url origin git@github.com:user/repo2.git
                ```
            </script>

              ###Using Gists for Cheatsheets
              ----------------------------
              * Make new gists here: https://gist.github.com/
              * After you create the gist, you'll see some links in the right-hand column
              * You can clone gists.  The advantage is that you can use your favorite text editor to edit the gist, as well as having a local copy of the gist.
              
              Consider this an easter egg; it's a file I keep on my hard drive that compiled all the useful commands from a GitHub training class I attended 
              [Useful Git Commands](https://gist.github.com/ldang/e6be1032c6a59cf2dbca)

              * Note: While you can make public or secret gists, there is no access control on the gists themselves.  If you know the URL, you can get to the gist.

              --------------------------------------

                * Many people use this feature purely to host websites or blogs or slides

              * You can manually set it up using the git command line
                * gh-pages is a special branchname to GitHub.  It is assumed that whatever is published to the gh-pages branch can be served up by a webserver
                * Additionally, GitHub automatically renders Markdown as HTML, so you can even publish Markdown documents and have it show up as styled HTML
                * So basically, all you have to do is to make sure that you have a gh-pages branch and that it contains the files needed for the webpage

              -------------------------------------
              This is how I "published" my slides on GitHub pages
              ```
              # Go into my git repo, which is already connected to GitHub
              cd git-github-talk-2014-10-09
              # Make a new branch gh-pages
              git checkout -b gh-pages
              # Push this new branch back to GitHub
              git push -u gh-pages
              ```
            </script>

              ###Publishing webpages on GitHub (4)
              --------------------------------
              * When working with webpages, it's usually a good idea to do the editing on a development branch or on master
              * When you are ready to update the webpage itself, then you can push those updates to the gh-pages branch
              * GitHub has some server-side processes that does a little processing to complete the publication process. 
              * A side effect is that your updates may take a little bit of time to go live.

              --------------------------------
              Example, where development was done on the master branch
              ```
              # go to gh-pages branch
              git checkout gh-pages
              # Bring in changes from master branch
              git rebase master
              # Push the changes in gh-pages to GitHub
              git push origin gh-pages 
              # go back to master and do more development
              git checkout master
              ```
